# NotTetris

All is heavily inspired by the NES Tetris version (same with controls, well emulator controls)
Most of the music is AI generated (pretty fire tbh)

The best feature about the game is prob the option to chose difficulty *and powerups, if I had time to make them*.

Movement keys:

S and ↓: Movement down/fast drop
A and ←: Movement left
D and →: Movement Right
X: Rotate the tetris block

Interaction keys:

Mouse Button Left: Left Click, interact
